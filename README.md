# Milkyroute's Automatic Depots
This mod aims to automate train movements from and into depots. For now, it is in Alpha phase.

For any bug report or feature suggestion, please create an Issue, or contact me via Discord (milkyroute) or in the comments of the Steam Workshop page. I can take some time to respond: please be patient!

Roadmap:
* Make sure the mod is bug-free
* Make the mod work with black hole depots
* Make the mod easier to use
* Write a full and nice tutorial
